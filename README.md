## Feature Extraction Methods for Predicting the Prevalence of Heart Disease

Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the world and Cardiac Arrhythmias is one of the leading causes of cardiac death in the world today. In this study, features are extracted from an arrhythmias dataset and different kinds of arrhythmias are classified. Random Forests, Boosted Trees, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the feature extraction techniques used. After the features are extracted, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used. From the performance measures calculated it can be seen that CNN is the best feature extraction method with an accuracy of 95.53%.
